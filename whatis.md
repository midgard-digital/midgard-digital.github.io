# What is a stake pool

Midgard is a [Cardano stake pool](https://cardano.org/stake-pool-operation/). The Cardano network uses stake pools to facilitate transactions and mint new blocks. They can be either public or private.

Users can [deligate their ADA](https://cardano.org/stake-pool-delegation/) to any public pools and, in return, receive rewards for their participation. Every year the rewards received are on average 5-6%. Staking your ADA with a public staking pool is 100% safe. Your ADA never leaves your wallet and is never locked, thus earning you 5-6% a year in passive income.

Stake pools are run by a reliable operator, either an individual or a business, with the knowledge and resources to run the node consistentlyâ€”usually experts in their fields.
