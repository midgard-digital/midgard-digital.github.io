# What is a stake pool

Midgard is a [Cardano stake pool](https://cardano.org/stake-pool-operation/). Stake pools are used by the Cardano network to faciliate transactions and mint new blocks. They can be either public or private. 

Users can [deligate their ADA](https://cardano.org/stake-pool-delegation/) to any public pools and in return recieve reweards for their participation. On a yearly basis the rewards receieved are on average 5-6%. Staking your ADA with a public staking pool os 100% safe. Your ADA never leaves your wallet and is never locked. Thus earning you 5-6% a year in passive income.

Stake pools are run by a reliable operator, either an individual or a business with the knowledge and resources to run the node on a consistent basis. Usually experts in their fields.
