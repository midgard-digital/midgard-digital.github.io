# Midgard and the SundaeSwap Reverse ISO
<small>{{ page.date | date_to_string: "ordinal", "EU" }}</small>

Many things can be said about SundaeSwap, how they managed their ISO and how that affected the single pool operators in the Cardano community. I'm not going to add to that critisism right now, enough has been said already, but at least we are on the list of [authorized sites](https://iso.sundaeswap.finance/#/reverse-pools).

So [stake](https://midgard.digital/howto) with us before the 19th of February and earn juicy Sundae tokens.
