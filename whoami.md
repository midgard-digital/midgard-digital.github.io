# Kjartan Sverrisson

I'm the CEO of [Overcast ehf](https://www.overcast.is), an Icelandic software company specializing in web development. I'm also a family man from Iceland, where I live with my wife and three kids.

I know this site is not exactly what you would see from our company; what matters is the secure operation of the pool you are staking your funds.

## Why Crypto? 
I mined my first BTC in 2013 and was sold on the concept right away. Since then, I've been more and more convinced that we need financial decentralization. We need more economic power for the regular Jane and the regular Joe. Not to mention what cryptocurrency can do for the poorer nations of the world.

I'm no longer as hot on BTC as I was. It's slow and environmentally unsustainable. But Cardano solved those issues brilliantly. 

### Have any questions?
I'm in this for the long run, and I hope you'll join me. If you have any questions, I'm available for you on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kjartans) and our pool's [Telegram channel](https://t.me/midgardpool). Feel free to reach out.
