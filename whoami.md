# Kjartan Sverrisson

I'm the CEO of [Overcast ehf](https://www.overcast.is), an Icelandic software company specializing in web development. I'm also a family man from Iceland where I live with my wife and three kids.

I know this site is not exactly what you would see from our company; what matters is the secure operation of the pool you are staking your funds with, so I've put my efforts there rather than designing a cool looking site.

## Why Crypto? 
I mined my first BTC in 2013 and was sold on the concept right away. Since then I've been more and more convinced that we need financial decentralisation and we need more financial power to the regular Jane and the regular Joe. Not to mention what cryptocurrency can do for the poorer nations of the world.

I'm no longer hot on BTC as I was. It's slow and environentally unsustainable. But Cardano solved thos issues brilliantly. 

### Have any questions?
I'm in this for the long run and I hope you'll join me. If you have any questions I'm available for you on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kjartans) and our pool's [Telegram channel](https://t.me/midgardpool). Feel free to reach out.
