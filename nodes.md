# Our Cardano node servers

We run our nodes on cloud infrastructure to maintain 100% uptime. 

We do this by always keeping backups for both relay-nodes and core-nodes on standby while maintaining comprehensive monitoring of all system resources.

The cloud also enables us to maintain very low network latency so that our relays can reach neighboring relays well within the 50ms benchmark set by the Cardano network.
