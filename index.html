	<h2>We're building and we want you to build with us!</h2>
	<p>So, while we are building our pool and increasing our block processing, we want you to get some of the upside from that, so we will only charge the minimum variable fee per epoch, until epoch 266.</p>
	<p>Consider staking your ADA with us, you won't regret it.</p>

	<h2>Nodes</h2>
	<p>We run our nodes on cloud infrastructur with the goal of maintaining 100% uptime. We do this by always keeping backups for both relay-nodes and core-nodes on standby while maintaining comprehensive monitoring of all system resources. </p>
	<p>The cloud also enbles us to maintain very low network latency so that our relays can reach neighbouring relays well within the 50ms benchmark set by the Cardano network.</p>
