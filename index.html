	<h2>We're building and we want you to build with us!</h2>
	<p>So, while we are building our pool and increasing our block processing, we want you to get some of the upside from that, so we will only charge the minimum variable fee per epoch, until epoch 266.</p>
	<p>Our pool runs on cloud services, set up to run securly and fast in order to get blocks mined by our node out to the network well within the 50 ms benchmark set by the network.</p>
	<p>Consider staking your ADA with us, you won't regret it.</p>
