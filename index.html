	<h2>We're building and we want you to build with us!</h2>
	<p>So, while we are building our pool and increasing our block processing, we want you to get some of the upside from that, so we will only charge the minimum variable fee per epoch, until epoch 266.</p>
	<p>Consider staking your ADA with us, you won't regret it.</p>

	<h2>Nodes</h2>
	<p>We run our nodes on cloud infrastructur with the goal of maintaining 100% uptime. We do this by always keeping backups for both relay-nodes and core-nodes on standby while maintaining comprehensive monitoring of all system resources. </p>
	<p>The cloud also enbles us to maintain very low network latency so that our relays can reach neighbouring relays well within the 50ms benchmark set by the Cardano network.</p>

	<h2>Who are we</h2>
	<h3>Kjartan Sverrisson</h3>
	<p>I'm the CEO of Overcast ehf, an Icelandic software company specializing in web development. I know, this site is not exactly what you would see from our company, what matters is the secure operation of the Pool you are staking your funds with, so we put our efforts there in stead.</p>
	<p>I mined my first BTC in 2013 and haven't sold out yet. I'm in this for the long run. You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/kjartans">Twitter</a> and our pool's <a href="https://t.me/midgardpool"></a>Telegram channel</a>. </p>
