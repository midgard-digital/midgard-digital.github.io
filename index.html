	<h2>We're building, and we want you to build with us!</h2>
	<p>So, while we are building our pool and increasing our block processing, we want you to get some of the upsides from that, so we will only charge the minimum variable fee per epoch until epoch 266.</p>
	<p>Consider staking your ADA with us; you won't regret it.</p>

	<h2>Nodes</h2>
	<p>We run our nodes on cloud infrastructure to maintain 100% uptime. We do this by always keeping backups for both relay-nodes and core-nodes on standby while maintaining comprehensive monitoring of all system resources.</p>
	<p>The cloud also enables us to maintain very low network latency so that our relays can reach neighboring relays well within the 50ms benchmark set by the Cardano network.</p>

	<h2>Who am I</h2>
	<h3>Kjartan Sverrisson</h3>
	<p>I'm the CEO of <a href="https://www.overcast.is">Overcast ehf</a>, an Icelandic software company specializing in web development. I know this site is not exactly what you would see from our company; what matters is the secure operation of the pool you are staking your funds with, so we put our efforts there instead.</p>
	<p>Why Crypto? I mined my first BTC in 2013 and haven't sold out yet. I'm in this for the long run. </p>
	<p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/kjartans">Twitter</a> and our pool's <a href="https://t.me/midgardpool">Telegram channel</a>. </p>

	<h2>Why stake my ADA?</h2>
	<p>Staking ADA is a secure way to earn interest on your hard earned coins and you can do that directly from within your own <a href="https://yoroi-wallet.com">Yoroi</a> or <a href="https://daedaluswallet.io">Daedalus</a> wallet. The best part is that ADA never leaves your wallet and you retain full control over any and all funds that you deligate to a pool.</p> 
	<p>Earnings are automatically paid out, by the Cardano protocol, to your wallet every five days.</p>
	<p>Please make sure only to use <u>official versions</u> of any wallet you choose.</p>
