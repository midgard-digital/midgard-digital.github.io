# Wallets

Most people usually talk about their ADA being stored in a [wallet](https://cardano.org/stake-pool-delegation#wallets). While this is technically true, the wallet it self is only a window into the blockchain where your funds are securly stored and only accessible to you.

When you set up a wallet for the first time you are presented with a list of words (up to 24 words) which you can use to restore your wallet on another device. 

***It's vitally important that this list of words is stored in a secure place, because who ever has access to the list can gain access to your ADA.***

Please make sure that you download only <u>official versions</u> of any wallet you choose. 

Currently Cardano recommends [Daedalus (Windows, Mac, Linux)](https://daedaluswallet.io) and [Yoroi (iOS and Android)](https://yoroi-wallet.com/).
