# How do I delegate my ADA?

Delegating your ADA is done through the delegation center in Daedalus or in the staking center in Yoroi, which is found on the dashboard page.

Both wallets provide you with a list of stake pools and all sorts of statistical data to help you choose the correct stake pool for you. I'd be honored if you decided on Midgard. 

To stake with Midgard, you can either search for the MGARD pool ticker or search for our pool ID.

## Pool information
- Pool Ticker: MGARD
