# What are the costs?

A stake pool earns its revenue in two ways. 

One is a fixed fee of 340A every epoch, paid by the Cardano reserve to the pool operator. The pool operator only earns this fee when the pool generates at least one block. While pools are small, they may not generate new blocks and thus not earn any revenue.

The other is a margin of the delegator's rewards. The margin is a small percentage and is credited automatically to the pool when the Cardano protocol pays the rewards.

However, until epoch 328, our margin is 0%, meaning that all delegators will keep 100% of their rewards, and the pool only gets the 340A.

# Why charge for delegation?

Running a Cardano node is time-consuming, complex, and required a skillset consisting of understanding blockchain technology, running secure networks and servers, and keeping everything up to date at all times. 

Cardano nodes are the backbone of the Cardano network, and work needed to keep the network up and running should be rewarded somehow. After all, we all have to eat :)
