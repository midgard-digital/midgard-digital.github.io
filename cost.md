# What are the costs?

A stake pool earns it's revenue in two ways. 

One is a fixed fee of 340A every epoch, which is paid by the Cardano reserve to the pool operator. The pool operator only earn this fee when the pool generates at least one block, so while pools are small some epochs they may not generate new blocks and thus not earn any revenue.

The other is a margin of the delegators rewards. This is a small percantage and is credited automatically to the pool when the rewards are paid out. However, until epoch 328 our margin is 0%, meaning that all delegators will keep 100% of their rewards and the pool only get's the 340A.

# Why charge for delegation?

Running a Cardano node is time consuming, complex and required a skill set consisting of understanding blockchain technology, running secure networks and servers and keeping everything up to date at all times. 

Cardano nodes are the backbone of the Cardano network and work needed to keep the network up and running should be rewarded in some way. After all, we all have to eat :)
